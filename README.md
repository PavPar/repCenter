# Workshop Overseer
A simple project for TU Graz web development course at SPbPU.

## Installation
Unpack the folder to the htdocs, update lib/config.php with actual DB credentials and root path, use your browser.

### **Important!**
**Please, install the samples first. As the software itself is merely a window to the workshop, you won't be able to actually create and remove staff (leave that to more powerful and experienced)**.
